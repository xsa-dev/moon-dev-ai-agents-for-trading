This project explores the potential of [artificial financial intelligence](https://www.afi.xyz) - a focused implementation of AI for trading and investing research.

**⚠️ IMPORTANT: This is an experimental project. There are NO guarantees of profitability. Trading involves substantial risk of loss.**

## 🎯 Vision
We're researching AI agents for trading that will eventually leverage [AFI](https://www.afi.xyz). With 4 years of experience training humans through our [bootcamp](https://algotradecamp.com), we're exploring where AI agents might complement human trading operations, and later replace trading human operations. This is experimental research, not a profitable trading solution.

## 🧠 Hypothesis
AI agents will be able to build a better quant portfolio than humans. i've spent the last 4 years building quant systems & training others to do so. 2025 is about replicating that success but with ai agents doing it instead of me. in 2026 i will release a paper of my findings after a full year of testing ai agents in quant vs the last 4 years of humans.

## 💡 Concept
AI agents might help address common trading challenges:
- Emotional reactions
- Ego-driven decisions
- Inconsistent execution
- Fatigue effects
- Impatience
- Fear & Greed cycles

While we use the RBI framework for strategy research, we're exploring AI agents as potential tools. We're in early stages with LLM technology, investigating possibilities in the trading space.
