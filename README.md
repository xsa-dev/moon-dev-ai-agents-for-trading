This project explores the potential of [artificial financial intelligence](https://www.afi.xyz) - a focused implementation of AI for trading and investing research.

**⚠️ IMPORTANT: This is an experimental project. There are NO guarantees of profitability. Trading involves substantial risk of loss.**

## 🎯 Vision
We're researching AI agents for trading that will eventually leverage [AFI](https://www.afi.xyz). With 4 years of experience training humans through our [bootcamp](https://algotradecamp.com), we're exploring where AI agents might complement human trading operations, and later replace trading human operations. This is experimental research, not a profitable trading solution.

## 🧠 Hypothesis
AI agents will be able to build a better quant portfolio than humans. i've spent the last 4 years building quant systems & training others to do so. 2025 is about replicating that success but with ai agents doing it instead of me. in 2026 i will release a paper of my findings after a full year of testing ai agents in quant vs the last 4 years of humans.

## 💡 Concept
AI agents might help address common trading challenges:
- Emotional reactions
- Ego-driven decisions
- Inconsistent execution
- Fatigue effects
- Impatience
- Fear & Greed cycles

While we use the RBI framework for strategy research, we're exploring AI agents as potential tools. We're in early stages with LLM technology, investigating possibilities in the trading space.

**PLEASE READ CAREFULLY:**

1. This is an experimental research project, NOT a trading system
2. There are NO plug-and-play solutions for guaranteed profits
3. We do NOT provide trading strategies
4. Success depends entirely on YOUR:
   - Trading strategy
   - Risk management
   - Market research
   - Testing and validation
   - Overall trading approach

5. NO AI agent can guarantee profitable trading
6. You MUST develop and validate your own trading approach
7. Trading involves substantial risk of loss
8. Past performance does not indicate future results

## Live Agents
- Trading Agent (`trading_agent.py`): Example agent that analyzes token data via LLM to make basic trade decisions
- Strategy Agent (`strategy_agent.py`): Manages and executes trading strategies placed in the strategies folder
- Risk Agent (`risk_agent.py`): Monitors and manages portfolio risk, enforcing position limits and PnL thresholds
- Copy Agent (`copy_agent.py`): monitors copy bot for potential trades
- Whale Agent (`whale_agent.py`): monitors whale activity and announces when a whale enters the market
- Sentiment Agent (`sentiment_agent.py`): analyzes Twitter sentiment for crypto tokens with voice announcements
- Listing Arbitrage Agent (`listingarb_agent.py`): identifies promising Solana tokens on CoinGecko before they reach major exchanges like Binance and Coinbase, using parallel AI analysis for technical and fundamental insights
- Focus Agent (`focus_agent.py`): randomly samples audio during coding sessions to maintain productivity, providing focus scores and voice alerts when focus drops (~$10/month, perfect for voice-to-code workflows)
