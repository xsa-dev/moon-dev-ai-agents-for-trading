# 🤖 AI AGENTS FOR TRADING

[![Moon Dev](moondev.png)](https://www.moondev.com/)

**⚠️ IMPORTANT: This is an experimental project. There are NO guarantees of profitability. Trading involves substantial risk of loss.**

This project explores the potential of [artificial financial intelligence](https://www.afi.xyz) - a focused implementation of AI for trading and investing research.

## 🎯 Vision
We're researching AI agents for trading that may eventually leverage [AFI](https://www.afi.xyz). With 4 years of experience training humans through our [bootcamp](https://algotradecamp.com), we're exploring where AI agents might complement human trading operations. This is experimental research, not a profitable trading solution.

## 💡 Concept
AI agents might help address common trading challenges:
- Emotional reactions
- Ego-driven decisions
- Inconsistent execution
- Fatigue effects
- Impatience
- Fear & Greed cycles

While we use the RBI framework for strategy research, we're exploring AI agents as potential tools. We're in early stages with LLM technology, investigating possibilities in the trading space.

## 🗺️ Research Roadmap

### 1. Risk Control Agents
Exploring AI agents that could assist with risk management. This is purely experimental research into risk oversight possibilities.

### 2. Exit Agents
Researching potential exit timing assistance. This overlaps with risk management research but focuses on position management concepts.

### 3. Entry Agents
Investigating entry-focused concepts after risk management research.

### 4. Sentiment Collection Agents
Exploring ways to gather market sentiment from Twitter, Discord, and Telegram for research purposes.

### 5. Strategy Execution Agents
Researching concepts like:
- Multi-agent consensus
- Strategy validation
- Dynamic trade filtering

## Live Agents
- Trading Agent (found in src/agents/trading_agent.py): this is just an example trading agent that will collect data from the solana contract addresses that you put in the config (src/core/config.py) and then send to an llm in order to analyze that data. then make a decision (do nothing, buy or sell) and then execute the trade. this one is just an example and will not be profitable cause it has no strategy yet. 
   - in the future adding a strategy that they can trade won't be that hard but i just wanted to get an example live and then start building out my most important agent which is my risk agent. managing risk is everything in trading and humans don't do it well, so that's why i am building the risk agent first. 
   - training video: coming soon...
